Evaporator Fan Motor Specifications
This 115-volt 60Hz evaporator fan motor is located in the back of the freezer and circulates air over the refrigerator coils. These coils will convert the heat into cool air, which is then circulated. If the motor has failed, the freezer/refrigerator will become too warm because the fan motor is not circulating the cool air from the freezer into the refrigerator. This is a genuine OEM part. Please remember to disconnect the power to the appliance before starting your repair.
