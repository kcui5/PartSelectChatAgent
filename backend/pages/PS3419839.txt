Evaporator Fan Motor Kit 120V 60Hz Specifications
The evaporator fan motor (Motor Evaporator Fan, Evaporator Fan Motor Kit, Evaporator Fan Motor, Refrigerator Evaporator Fan Motor) circulates air through the food compartment for efficient cooling in refrigerators. The evaporator fan motor can squeal as its bearing dries out. The motor bearings can totally seize, preventing any movement. The motor coil can also burn out, preventing any fan movement. If this motor fails, the refrigerator compartment will warm up and eventually the freezer will reduce cooling as well. Excessive frost can build up on the evaporator coil due to lack of air movement. The motor can make a squealing noise when it is beginning to fail or will not operate at all when powered, and this is a sign it should be replaced. The evaporator is located in the rear of the freezer compartment. This part measures 2-1/2 inches wide by 3 inches tall by 1 inch thick, at its widest point. It is constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in black/silver. This kit includes the evaporator fan motor and harness.
