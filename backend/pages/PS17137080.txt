This OEM mid spray or center wash arm assembly distributes water and detergent in your dishwasher during the wash cycle. It has small nozzles that spray water onto your dishes and is located between the lower and upper rack. A broken assembly will result in weak water flow and ineffective dishwashing. It may also display signs of damage such as cracks, breaks, or missing nozzles. Additionally, a malfunctioning assembly can cause imbalanced water flow, potentially leading to damage to other dishwasher components such as filters or pumps. Prompt replacement is necessary to ensure proper dishwashing performance and prevent further damage.
