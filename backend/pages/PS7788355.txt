NOZZLE ASSEMBLY Specifications
This nozzle assembly, commonly referred to as a sprayer head or spray arm, is an authentic replacement part supplied directly by LG for use in LG dishwashers. The nozzle assembly can be found at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. It is responsible for spraying water onto the dishes and utensils inside the dishwasher using a series of nozzles that release pressure water. Over time, the sprayer head may become clogged due to a build of debris and soap residue, or it may also be damaged by a falling item. If the sprayer head is faulty, you will likely notice that your dishes are not cleaned properly after a cycle, and they have spots of leftover soap residue. It is important to replace the sprayer head to keep your dishwasher running efficiently.
