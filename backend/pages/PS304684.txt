Evaporator Fan Blade Kit Specifications
This kit features a 5-blade plastic evaporator fan blade that rotates CCW and measures 4.5-inches in diameter and has a 3/8-inch-tall shaft. This kit also has a metal compression ring that secures the fan to the evaporator. The evaporator mechanism is normally located in the freezer and is responsible for pulling the warmer air over the condenser coils, cooling it off and then blowing and circulating that cooler air through the rest of the refrigerator. If the freezer compartment has a frost buildup or if there is a lack of cooling and airflow in your refrigerator, this fan likely needs to be replaced. To replace your evaporator fan, you will likely need a screwdriver and a set of pliers and check your user manual for the exact location of your evaporator fan.
