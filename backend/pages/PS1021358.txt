Adjustable Leveling Screw Specifications
The adjustable leveling screws on the bottom of your dryer can be screwed in or out to lower or raise the leg level. If one of the leveling screws is stripped, damaged, or missing, you may not be able to create a level base for your dryer. The leveling screw has a hexagon-shaped gray plastic foot, with a screw that is approximately 1 inch in length. To replace a damaged screw, simply turn the old screw to the left, until it can be removed. Then, simply screw the new leveling screw into place on the bottom of the dryer, making sure it is the same height as the other 3 leveling screws.
