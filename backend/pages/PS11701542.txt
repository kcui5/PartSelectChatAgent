Refrigerator Ice and Water Filter Specifications
This is an OEM replacement ice and water filter for your refrigerator. In side-by-side refrigerators, it is found in the top right corner or the bottom left grille. In bottom-freezer refrigerators, the filter is in the bottom left grille. In top-freezer units, the filter is located in the middle of the refrigerator. This NSF certified filter reduces 28 contaminants including pharmaceuticals, metals, minerals, pesticides, cysts, industrial chemicals, Class I Particulates and chlorine. It is made up of coconut carbon block and has three layers of filtration. The first layer is particle filtration that helps block larger contaminants. The second layer is micro-filtration, which prevents medium-sized impurities from passing. The third layer is called absorption filtration, which absorbs microscopic-sized pollutants. It measures 2 inches deep, 2 inches wide, 1-1/2 inches high, and weighs 0.5 lbs. To ensure your filter is working its best, it needs to be replaced every six months. This single filter has a simple, quick-turn installation feature that does not require any tools.
