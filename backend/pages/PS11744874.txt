Spring, Lid Specifications
The dishwasher lid spring helps open the dispenser cover in the soap box when the control releases the latch. If your dishwasher does not dispense detergent, is broken and worn out, or the door is not opening properly, replacing the dispenser spring could be the solution. For this replacement you will need needle nose pliers. First, release the cover on the detergent dispenser, then remove the cover from the shaft it hinges on. Pull the shaft from one side and remove the spring from the shaft. Next, replace with the new spring and engage the two open hooks into the soap cover. Finally, grasp the hook and pull it over tab on the side of the wash cup. Verify that it works properly by opening and closing the cap. Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer for further instructions.
