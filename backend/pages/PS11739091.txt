Refrigerator Door Shelf Bin White Specifications
This refrigerator door shelf bin, also known as the door bin, or sometimes just a "bucket", is an authentic manufacturer-certified part made of white plastic and is easy to install. It is used to hold items in the fridge door, like jars, cans, and bottles, and you'll be able to visually see if the part is broken or warped. This particular shelf attaches directly to the fridge door; you should be able to pull out the old bin and snap the new one into place by observing the slots and pushing the bin down into them. You can check if this model is right for your appliance by checking your user manual and model number. The door bin measures about 18 inches wide, 4.5 inches high, by 7 inches deep. This door shelf bin is sold individually, so if your refrigerator takes multiple bins, which many do, you will need to order the appropriate amount of bins.
