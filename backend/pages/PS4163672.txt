Door Divider Spring Specifications
The French door divider spring fits most Samsung French door style refrigerators. The spring applies tension between components in the refrigerator, which engages and retracts the door flap. This will allow the door to close properly. If the spring is broken, damaged, or faulty the door flap will swing open and block the door from closing, and you should look to replace the part straight away to prevent further damage to the door. The spring is a genuine OEM part, is made of metal, and measures at 1 1/2" long. This part is also known as a refrigerator door mullion spring.
