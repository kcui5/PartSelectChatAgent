Refrigerator Door Switch Specifications
The interior light in your refrigerator is controlled by a switch that is activated when the door is opened and closed. If your refrigerator light will not turn on, or stays on when the door is closed, you could have a faulty switch. The switch is spring-loaded and is a generally closed type of switch meaning there should be no continuity when the button is pushed, and continuity through the switch when it is no longer engaged. This plastic, white, OEM switch is sourced directly from the manufacturer, is sold individually and is easy to replace. The repair usually takes less than 15 minutes and requires a flat-blade screwdriver and needle-nose pliers.
